<h1> Vinyl Siding </h1><br />
<p>
Vinyl siding is perfect choice for homeowners who are looking to give  an inexpensive and long-lasting look to their house.  Vinyl siding is also very durable  and easy to maintain. It comes in a variety of grains, thickness and colors.</p><br />
<img src="images/vinyl-siding-sale.jpg" alt="home vinyl siding sale" width="200" height="198"/>
<p>
Vinyl siding can stand up to most severe  weather conditions without worry of severe damage. In addition, vinyl siding can withstand years of sunlight without fading. Vinyl siding is now the number-one siding material available. And for good reason: Nothing beats vinyl siding, accessories and trim for sheer endurance. Unlike many other siding materials, vinyl is impervious to rain, cold, salt and snow. And it won't rot, peel, dent or show scratches, nor will it ever need painting. A simple soap-and-water rinse once a year is all that's required to remove dirt and maintain the look of freshly painted wood. 
</p><br />
<p>
So What Makes a Quality Vinyl Siding? The first thing to look at is panel thickness. If a panel is too thin it can show imperfections from the wall underneath. This (in my experience) has been the number one objection to vinyl siding and in most cases could have been avoided if a thicker panel had been used. Thicker panels do cost more but if your contractor is worth his salt, he will give you a price breakdown and it should only be in the hundreds opposed to the thousands for the upgrade. Here are the panel thickness breakdowns: Builder Grade (.040), Thin Residential Grade (.042), Standard Residential Grade (.044), Thick Residential Grade (.046) & Super Thick Grade (.050). These are the benchmarks as per our experience and should give you a great idea of the quality of the panel you are buying.
</p><br />
<p>
The initial cost of vinyl siding will vary depending on the size of the home and the quality of the siding. Vinyl siding is a great investment. Re-siding a home is among the top ten remodeling projects in terms of overall payback. And, if you re-side with vinyl, you can often recoup 100% or more of your investment - if you pick the right company, of course.
